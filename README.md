# memreader
A memory image analyzer in C. 



# Background
This is a rough project to help me get back into C programming. With respect to forensics, memory images are a gold mine of context around a case. Being able to read a memory image quickly and efficiently is a boon to a forensic analyst.



# Disclaimer
Tools to analyze memory images already exist, such as the well-known Volatility project. This project is not here to compete, but is a learning tool for myself. While what I am writing is attempting to accomplish the same goal, I would definitely recommend using Volatility or Mandiant's RedLine.
